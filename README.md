#Week 4 InClass Activities

Activity 0:
	Leo.Abe

Activity 1:
	There will be only one Locator because other Locators will be destoryed due to Destroy(gameObject), it's a classic Singleton Mode

Activity 2:

	Added the gamemanager as a singleton to control the game flow

#Week 5 InClass Activities

- Activity 1
I like this design because it seperates the function in to interface and abstracg class so it is easy to rewrite or implemnent or do extention, I would use the same technic in similar projects.

- Activity 2
Model: ItemW5Demo2, EnemyStats, and the player’s inventory data stored in PlayerW5Demo2._inventory

View: InventoryUI, DialogueBubble

Controller: PlayerW5Demo2 (handles input and triggers UI), EnemyW5Demo2 (drives dialogue visibility based on distance to the player)

- Activity 3

Scenario 1:

ScriptableObjects: record beat data, time need to be hit

Scenario 2:

Singleton: the managers(sessionManager, playersmanager)

Scenario 3:
Model-View-Controller with C# events: Nessasary for clear structual codes

Inheritance with polymorphism
	Basic parent class, abstract class, and/or interface: for example, there are multiple
	plants, can all have same identities(time to grow, spirte, selling price....), it's
	more orgnized to put them together though parent class
	
Finite State Machine with C# enums: For example, Player movement, animation need to be 
controlled through state machine(perhaps not finite state machine), and plants animation
might need state machine as well

Singleton: the managers(shopmanager, buildmanager, itemmanager...) are all singletons

ScriptableObjects: record player data, or configutate objects.

- Activity 4
Attendance: Leo Sydney Abe, Han Yang, Jing.Chen

#Week 6

- Activity 1
Gizmos: Draw out a visual shape that's used for determine anythings in unity that can't be seen or don't want be seen in player perspective.

Profiling: We can use this to check which functions are taking responsability of lagging.

BreakPoint: Helps identifing exceptions or any sort of error in your code(or not error, just wrong logic), stop and give it a check on variables and it's behaviors.

-Activity 2
Attendance: Leo Sydney Abe, Han Yang, Jing.Chen

#Week 7

-Activity 1
Finite State Machine: used for purposes like monster agro, movement, behaviours... easy to add more states and operate in a clear order.

Raycast: literally draw a line or shoot a ray in the scene, and you can adjust many variables to control it, and you can use it to detect game objects or do calculations based on the numbers obtained. 

-Activity 2
Attendance: Leo Sydney Abe, Han Yang, Jing.Chen

-Activity 3

#Week 8

-Activity 1
Post-processing effect: effects added after the scene is rendered to change how the final image looks, like adding blur, glow, or color adjustments.

Unity Render Pipeline: the system in Unity that controls how a scene is rendered and turned into the final image on the screen.

-Activity 2
Attendance: Leo Sydney Abe, Han Yang, Jing.Chen

-Activity 3
Buddy Team : Fate GameMaker

Note:Use keybinds for interacting with stuff. Lock cursor to the center of the screen. Disable player movement while dialogue exchange is happening. Add in-dialogue and out-of-dialogue states to control player behavior while dialogue is and isn't happening.

-Activity 4
Task for today: make an inventory system

-Activity 5
